## Prerequisites:
First of all, you're going to need an ESP8266 board. They are available off of AliExpress for a decent price. You're also going to need a 16x2 LCD with preferably a header attached to the back, it saves you from soldering the pins. Jumper cables should be bought as well, and a breadboard. These are pretty self-explanatory. Adding a buzzer is optional. You'll also need to install some libraries, be sure to check the includes.
